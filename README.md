# Django Practice Projects

I’ve been learning Django by building small hands-on projects. These mini projects helps me understand how backend logic actually works.

## What I built

* **Time page** – Displays the current server time (basic view logic)
* **Form submission page** – Takes user input and shows it after submit (POST handling)
* **JSON endpoint** – Returns a list of users in JSON format
* **Dynamic URLs** – Routes like `/greet/Bikrant/` or `/square/5/`
* **Database integration** – Created models, stored data, fetched data from the database, and displayed it on a page (e.g., `/product/101/`)

## What I learned

* How Django views work
* Difference between GET and POST
* Request → URL → View → Response flow
* How to return JSON responses
* How to handle forms
* How dynamic routing works
* How to create models and run migrations
* How to fetch data from the database using Django ORM and display it

Still learning and improving .......


## Run Project: 

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Then open browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```
Then you will see a homepage with links to the three mini-projects(features).
