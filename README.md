# Django Mini Projects

This repository contains simple beginner Django projects that demonstrate basic backend concepts. These projects helped me understand how Django handles requests, forms, and JSON responses.


## Projects Included

### 1️. Time Page (Basic View Logic)

* Displays the current server time.
* Shows how a Django view works.
* Demonstrates returning a simple HTTP response.

---

### 2. Form Submission (POST Handling)

* A simple form where user enters their name.
* After submitting, the page displays the entered name.
* Demonstrates:

  * POST requests
  * Form handling
  * Passing data to templates

---

### 3. JSON API Endpoint (Data Response)

* Returns a list of users in JSON format.
* Demonstrates:

  * API-style response
  * JsonResponse
  * Backend data formatting

From these mini projects I learned:

* How Django views work
* Difference between GET and POST
* How data flows from browser → server → browser
* How to return JSON responses
* Basic request handling
